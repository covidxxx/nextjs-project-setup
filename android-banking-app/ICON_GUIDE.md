# How to Add Your Custom App Icon

## Icon Folders and Sizes

I've created the proper folder structure for your app icons. Here's where to place your custom icons:

### Folder Structure:
```
android-banking-app/app/src/main/res/
├── mipmap-mdpi/     (48x48 pixels)
├── mipmap-hdpi/     (72x72 pixels)
├── mipmap-xhdpi/    (96x96 pixels)
├── mipmap-xxhdpi/   (144x144 pixels)
└── mipmap-xxxhdpi/  (192x192 pixels)
```

## Steps to Add Your Icon:

### 1. Prepare Your Icon Files
Create your icon in these sizes:
- **ic_launcher.png** (48x48) → Place in `mipmap-mdpi/`
- **ic_launcher.png** (72x72) → Place in `mipmap-hdpi/`
- **ic_launcher.png** (96x96) → Place in `mipmap-xhdpi/`
- **ic_launcher.png** (144x144) → Place in `mipmap-xxhdpi/`
- **ic_launcher.png** (192x192) → Place in `mipmap-xxxhdpi/`

### 2. Icon Requirements
- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Name**: Must be exactly `ic_launcher.png`
- **Shape**: Square (Android will automatically apply rounded corners)
- **Background**: Should have a solid background (not transparent for launcher icons)

### 3. Easy Way to Create Multiple Sizes
You can use online tools like:
- Android Asset Studio (developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio)
- Or create one large icon (512x512) and resize it

### 4. In AIDE App:
1. Copy your icon files to the respective mipmap folders
2. Make sure each file is named exactly `ic_launcher.png`
3. Build and run your app

## Current Icon Setup:
- The app is already configured to use `@mipmap/ic_launcher` in AndroidManifest.xml
- Just replace the icon files in the mipmap folders with your custom icons

## Icon Design Tips:
- Use bright, contrasting colors
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider the yellow theme of your banking app
- Test how it looks on different Android launchers

## Does the Icon Fit the Picture?
Looking at your banking app screenshot, a good icon would be:
- Yellow/gold color scheme to match the app theme
- Banking-related symbol (like a wallet, bank building, or currency symbol)
- Clean, modern design that's readable at small sizes
- Square format with the important elements centered

The icon will appear on the home screen, app drawer, and in the recent apps list, so make sure it represents your banking app well!
